1. ### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript?

    There are many ways to create objects in javascript as below,


     5. **Function constructor with prototype:**
         This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,

        ```javascript
        function Person(){}
        Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer";
        var object = new Person();
        ```

        This is equivalent to an instance created with an object create method with a function prototype and then call that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.
        ```javascript
        function func {};

        new func(x, y, z);

        **(OR)**

        // Create a new instance using function prototype.
        var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)

        // Call the function
        var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),

        // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
        console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
        ```

    7. **Singleton pattern:**
        A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.
        ```javascript
        var object = new function(){
          this.name = "Sudheer";
        }
        ```

2. ### What is prototype chain?

    **Prototype chaining** is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language. The prototype on object instance is available through **Object.getPrototypeOf(object)** or __proto__ property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through object.prototype.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

3. ### What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind?
    The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

    **Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one
    ```javascript
    var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
    var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
        console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
    }

    invite.call(employee1, 'Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
    invite.call(employee2, 'Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
    ```
    **Apply:** Invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array
    ```javascript
    var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
    var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
        console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
    }

    invite.apply(employee1, ['Hello', 'How are you?']); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
    invite.apply(employee2, ['Hello', 'How are you?']); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
    ```
    **bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to pass in an array and any number of arguments
    ```javascript
    var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
    var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
        console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
    }

    var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
    var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
    inviteEmployee1('Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
    inviteEmployee2('Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
    ```
    Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it‚Äôs easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array. Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind().

7. ### What is the difference between slice and splice?

    Some of the major difference in a tabular form

    | Slice | Splice |
    |---- | ---------
    | Doesn't modify the original array(immutable)  | Modifies the original array(mutable) |
    | Returns the subset of original array | Returns the deleted elements as array  |
    | Used to pick the elements from array | Used to insert or delete elements to/from array|

8. ### How do you compare Object and Map?
    **Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases.

    1. The keys of an Object are Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.
    2. The keys in Map are ordered while keys added to object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in order of insertion.
    3. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.
    4. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.
    5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by using map = Object.create(null), but this is seldom done.
    6. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.

9. ### What is the difference between == and === operators?

    JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators takes type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,
    1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
    2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value.
       There are two special cases in this,
       1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
       2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
    3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
    4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
    5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e,
        null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true

    Some of the example which covers the above cases,

    ```javascript
    0 == false   // true
    0 === false  // false
    1 == "1"     // true
    1 === "1"    // false
    null == undefined // true
    null === undefined // false
    '0' == false // true
    '0' === false // false
    []==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
    {}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
    ```

13. ### What is a higher order function?
    Higher-order function is a function that accepts other function as an argument or returns a function as a return value.
    ```javascript
    const firstOrderFunc = () => console.log ('Hello I am a First order function');
    const higherOrder = ReturnFirstOrderFunc => ReturnFirstOrderFunc ();
    higherOrder (firstOrderFunc);
    ```

16. ### (Possibly Redux) What is a pure function?

    A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value. Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,
    ```javascript
    //Impure
    let numberArray = [];
    const impureAddNumber = number => numberArray.push (number);
    //Pure
    const pureAddNumber = number => argNumberArray =>
      argNumberArray.concat ([number]);

    //Display the results
    console.log (impureAddNumber (6)); // returns 6
    console.log (numberArray); // returns [6]
    console.log (pureAddNumber (7) (numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
    console.log (numberArray); // returns [6]
    ```
    As per above code snippets, Push function is impure itself by altering the array and returning an push number index which is independent of parameter value. Whereas Concat on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of previous array.
    Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and makes harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with **Immutability** concept of ES6 by giving preference to **const** over **let** usage.

17. ### What is the purpose of let keyword?

    The `let` statement declares a **block scope local variable**. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the var keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,
    ```javascript
    let counter = 30;
    if (counter === 30) {
      let counter = 31;
      console.log(counter); // 31
    }
    console.log(counter); // 30 (because if block variable won't exist here)
    ```

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

18. ### What is the difference between let and var?
    You can list out the differences in a tabular format

    | var | let |
    |---- | ---------
    | It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript  | Introduced as part of ES6 |
    | It has function scope | It has block scope  |
    | Variables will be hoisted | Hoisted but not initialized |

    Let's take an example to see the difference,
    ```javascript
    function userDetails(username) {
       if(username) {
         console.log(salary); // undefined(due to hoisting)
         console.log(age); // error: age is not defined
         let age = 30;
         var salary = 10000;
       }
       console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible to due function scope)
       console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
    }
    ```

22. ### What is IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?
    IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,
    ```javascript
    (function ()
        {
          // logic here
        }
     )
    ();
    ```
    The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables with IIFE then it throws an error as below,
    ```javascript
    (function ()
            {
              var message = "IIFE";
              console.log(message);
            }
     )
    ();
    console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined
    ```

23. ### What is the benefit of using modules?
    There are a lot of benefits to using modules in favour of a sprawling. Some of the benefits are,
    1. Maintainablity
    2. Reusability
    3. Namespacing

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

26. ### What are classes in ES6?
    In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript‚Äôs existing prototype-based inheritance.
    For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,
    ```javascript
    function Bike(model,color) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
    }

    Bike.prototype.getDetails = function() {
        return this.model + ' bike has' + this.color + ' color';
    };
    ```
    Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative
    ```javascript
    class Bike{
      constructor(color, model) {
        this.color= color;
        this.model= model;
      }

      getDetails() {
        return this.model + ' bike has' + this.color + ' color';
      }
    }
    ```

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

27. ### What are closures?
    A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function‚Äôs variables. The closure has three scope chains
    1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
    2. Outer function‚Äôs variables
    3. Global variables
    Let's take an example of closure concept,
    ```javascript
    function Welcome(name){
      var greetingInfo = function(message){
       console.log(message+' '+name);
      }
    return greetingInfo;
    }
    var myFunction = Welcome('John');
    myFunction('Welcome '); //Output: Welcome John
    myFunction('Hello Mr.'); //output: Hello Mr.John
    ```
    As per the above code, the inner function(greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(Welcome) even after outer function has returned.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

28. ### What are modules?
    Modules refers small units of independent, reusable code and also act as foundation of many JavaScript design patterns.  Most of the JavaScript modules export an object literal, a function, or a constructor

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

29. ### Why do you need modules?
    Below are the list of benefits using modules in javascript ecosystem
    1. Maintainablity
    2. Reusability
    3. Namespacing

31. ### What is a service worker?
    A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in background, separate from a web page and provide features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and programmatically managing a cache of responses.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

32. ### How do you manipulate DOM using service worker?
    Service worker can't access the DOM directly. But it can communicate with the pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the `postMessage` interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

33. ### How do you reuse information across service worker restarts?
    The problem with service worker is that it get terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's `onfetch` and `onmessage` handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

34. ### What is IndexedDB?
    IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of larger amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

35. ### What is web storage?
    Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.
    1. **Local storage:** It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
    2. **Session storage:** It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

36. ### What is a post message?
    Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

37. ### What is a Cookie?
    A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.
    For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,
    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John";
    ```

    ![Screenshot](images/cookie.png)

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

38. ### Why do you need a Cookie?
    Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,
    1. When a user visits a web page, user profile can be stored in a cookie.
    2. Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers user profile.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

39. ### What are the options in a cookie?
    There are few below options available for a cookie,
    1. By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can change this behavior by setting expiry date (in UTC time).
    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC";
    ```
    2. By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to using a path parameter.
    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John path=/services";
    ```

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

40. ### How do you delete a cookie?
    You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date. You don't need to specify a cookie value in this case.
    For example, you can delete a username cookie in the current page as below.
    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
    ```
    **Note:** You should define the cookie path option to ensure that you delete the right cookie. Some browsers doesn't allow to delete a cookie unless you specify a path parameter.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

41. ### What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage?
    Below are some of the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage,

    | Feature | Cookie | Local storage | Session storage |
    |---- | --------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Accessed on client or server side | Both server-side & client-side | client-side only | client-side only |
    | Lifetime | As configured using Expires option  | until deleted | until tab is closed |
    | SSL support | Supported | Not supported | Not supported |
    | Maximum data size | 4KB | 5 MB | 5MB |

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

42. ### What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?
    LocalStorage is same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

46. ### Why do you need web storage?
    Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Also, the information is never transferred to the server. Hence this is recommended approach than Cookies.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

49. ### Give an example of web worker?
    You need to follow below steps to start using web workers for counting example
    1. Create a Web Worker File:  You need to write a script to increment the count value. Let's name it as counter.js
    ```javascript
    let i = 0;

    function timedCount() {
      i = i + 1;
      postMessage(i);
      setTimeout("timedCount()",500);
    }

    timedCount();
    ```
    Here postMessage() method is used to post a message back to the HTML page
    2. Create a Web Worker Object: You can create a web worker object by checking for browser support. Let's name this file as web_worker_example.js
    ```javascript
    if (typeof(w) == "undefined") {
      w = new Worker("counter.js");
    }
    ```
    and we can receive messages from web worker
    ```javascript
    w.onmessage = function(event){
      document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = event.data;
    };
    ```
    3. Terminate a Web Worker:
    Web workers will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated. You can use terminate() method to terminate listening the messages.
    ```javascript
    w.terminate();
    ```
    4. Reuse the Web Worker: If you set the worker variable to undefined you can reuse the code
    ```javascript
    w = undefined;
    ```

51. ### What is a promise?
    A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it‚Äôs not resolved(for example, network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

    The syntax of Promise creation looks like below,
    ```js
        const promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
          // promise description
        })
    ```

    The usage of a promise would be as below,

    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("I'm a Promise!");
      }, 5000);
    }, reject => {

    });

    promise.then(value => console.log(value));
    ```
    The action flow of a promise will be as below,

    ![Screenshot](images/promises.png)

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

52. ### Why do you need a promise?
    Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

53. ### What are the three states of promise?
    Promises have three states:
    1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
    2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that specified operation was completed.
    3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

54. ### What is a callback function?
    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.
    Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function
    ```javascript
    function callbackFunction(name) {
      console.log('Hello ' + name);
    }

    function outerFunction(callback) {
      let name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
      callback(name);
    }

    outerFunction(callbackFunction);
    ```
    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

55. ### Why do we need callbacks?
    The callbacks are needed because javascript is a event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
    Let's take an example with first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and next function which logs the message.
    ```javascript
    function firstFunction(){
      // Simulate a code delay
      setTimeout( function(){
        console.log('First function called');
      }, 1000 );
    }
    function secondFunction(){
      console.log('Second function called');
    }
    firstFunction();
    secondFunction();

    Output
    // Second function called
    // First function called
    ```
    As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of first function and remaining code block get executed. So callbacks used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn‚Äôt execute until other code finished execution.

57. ### What is server-sent events?
    Server-sent events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a browser to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection without resorting to polling. These are a one way communications channel - events flow from server to client only. This is been used in Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds etc.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

58. ### How do you receive server-sent event notifications?
    The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications. For example, you can receive messages from server as below,
    ```javascript
    if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
      var source = new EventSource("sse_generator.js");
      source.onmessage = function(event) {
        document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
      };
    }
    ```

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

60. ### What are the events available for server sent events?
    Below are the list of events available for server sent events
    | Event | Description |
    |---- | ---------
    | onopen  | It is used when a connection to the server is opened |
    | onmessage | This event is used when a message is received  |
    | onerror | It happens when an error occurs|

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

61. ### What are the main rules of promise?
    A promise must follow a specific set of rules,
    1. A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant `.then()` method
    2. A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state
    3. A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.
    4. Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

62. ### What is callback in callback?
    You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks.
    ```javascript
    loadScript('/script1.js', function(script) {
       console.log('first script is loaded');

      loadScript('/script2.js', function(script) {

        console.log('second script is loaded');

        loadScript('/script3.js', function(script) {

            console.log('third script is loaded');
          // after all scripts are loaded
        });

      })

    });
    ```

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

63. ### What is promise chaining?
    The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,
    ```javascript
    new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

      setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);

    }).then(function(result) {

      console.log(result); // 1
      return result * 2;

    }).then(function(result) {

      console.log(result); // 2
      return result * 3;

    }).then(function(result) {

      console.log(result); // 6
      return result * 4;

    });
    ```
    In the above handlers, the result is passed to the chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow,
    1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second,
    2. After that `.then` handler is called by logging the result(1) and then return a promise with the value of result * 2.
    3. After that the value passed to the next `.then` handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise with result * 3.
    4. Finally the value passed to the last `.then` handler by logging the result(6) and return a promise with result * 4.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

64. ### What is promise.all?
    Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected. For example, the syntax of promise.all method is below,
    ```javascript
    Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => {   console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`))
    ```
    **Note:** Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per input order.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

65. ### What is the purpose of race method in promise?
    Promise.race() method will return the promise instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. Let's take an example of race() method where promise2 is resolved first
    ```javascript
    var promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one');
    });
    var promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'two');
    });

    Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(value) {
      console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
    });
    ```

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

67. ### Why do you need strict mode?
    Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

71. ### What is typeof operator?
    You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the type of a variable or an expression.
    ```javascript
    typeof "John Abraham"     // Returns "string"
    typeof (1 + 2)        // Returns "number"
    ```

74. ### What is the difference between null and undefined?
    Below are the main differences between null and undefined,

    | Null | Undefined |
    |---- | -----------|
    | It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.  | It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. |
    | Type of null is object | Type of undefined is undefined  |
    | The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. | The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.|
    | Indicates the absence of a value for a variable | Indicates absence of variable itself |
    | Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations | Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations |

76. ### What is the difference between window and document?
    Below are the main differences between window and document,

    | Window | Document |
    |---- | ---------
    | It is the root level element in any web page  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM) |
    | By default window object is available implicitly in the page | You can access it via window.document or document.  |
    | It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementByTagName, createElement etc  |

77. ### How do you access history in javascript?
    The window.history object contains the browsers history. You can load previous and next URLs in the history using back() and next() methods.
    ```javascript
    function goBack() {
      window.history.back()
    }
    function goForward() {
      window.history.forward()
    }
    ```
    **Note:** You can also access history without window prefix.

79. ### What is isNaN?
    The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. i.e, This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.
    ```javascript
    isNaN('Hello') //true
    isNaN('100') //false
    ```

80. ### What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables?
    Below are the major differences between undeclared and undefined variables,

    | undeclared | undefined |
    |---- | ---------
    | These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared  | These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value |
    | If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered | If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.  |

85. ### What is an event flow?
    Event flow is the order in which event is received on the web page. When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click actually reaches its destination, or target element, it must trigger the click event each of its parent elements first, starting at the top with the global window object.
    There are two ways of event flow
    1. Top to Bottom(Event Capturing)
    2. Bottom to Top (Event Bubbling)

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

86. ### What is event bubbling?
    Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element.
    
    Event bubbling directs an event to its intended target, it works like this:
- A button is clicked and the event is directed to the button
- If an event handler is set for that object, the event is triggered
- If no event handler is set for that object, the event bubbles up (like a bubble in water) to the object‚Äôs parent


    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

87. ### What is event capturing?
    Event capturing is a type of event propagation where the event is first captured by the outermost element, and then successively triggers on the descendants (children) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the innermost DOM element.

    **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

90. ### What is the difference between document load and DOMContentLoaded events?
    The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for assets(stylesheets, images, and subframes) to finish loading. Whereas The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources(stylesheets, images).

93. ### What are the pros and cons of promises over callbacks?
    Below are the list of pros and cons of promises over callbacks,

    **Pros:**
    1. It avoids callback hell which is unreadable
    2. Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()
    3. Easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all()
    4. Solves some of the common problems of callbacks(call the callback too late, too early, many times and swallow errors/exceptions)

    **Cons:**
    1. It makes little complex code
    2. You need to load a polyfill if ES6 is not supported

94. ### What is the difference between an attribute and a property?
    Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes type and value,
    ```javascript
    <input type="text" value="Name:">
    ```
    You can retrieve the attribute value as below,
    ```javascript
    const input = document.querySelector('input');
    console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Good morning
    console.log(input.value); // Good morning
    ```
    And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like
    ```javascript
    console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Good morning
    console.log(input.value); // Good evening
    ```

95. ### What is same-origin policy?
    The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. If you enable this policy then it prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page using Document Object Model(DOM).

96. ### What is the purpose of void 0?
    Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing. This will be helpful to eliminate the unwanted side-effect, because it will return the undefined primitive value. It is commonly used for HTML document that uses href="JavaScript:Void(0);" within an <a> element. i.e, when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or refreshes the same page. But this behavior will be prevented using this expression.
    For example, the below link notify the message without reloading the page
    ```javascript
    <a href="JavaScript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Well done!')">Click Me!</a>
    ```

97. ### Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language?
    JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays  modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

100. ### What are events?
     Events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can `react` on these events. Some of the examples of HTML events are,

     1. Web page has finished loading
     2. Input field was changed
     3. Button was clicked

     Let's describe the behavior of click event for button element,

     ```javascript
     <!doctype html>
     <html>
      <head>
        <script>
          function greeting() {
            alert('Hello! Good morning');
          }
        </script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <button type="button" onclick="greeting()">Click me</button>
      </body>
     </html>
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

102. ### What is the use of preventDefault method?
     The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when clicking on hyper link are some common usecases.
     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("link").addEventListener("click", function(event){
      event.preventDefault();
     });
     ```
     **Note:** Remember that not all events are cancelable.

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

103. ### What is the use of stopPropagation method?
     The stopPropagation method is used to stop the event from bubbling up the event chain. For example, the below nested divs with stopPropagation method prevents default event propagation when clicking on nested div(Div1)
     ```javascript
     <p>Click DIV1 Element</p>
     <div onclick="secondFunc()">DIV 2
       <div onclick="firstFunc(event)">DIV 1</div>
     </div>

     <script>
     function firstFunc(event) {
       alert("DIV 1");
       event.stopPropagation();
     }

     function secondFunc() {
       alert("DIV 2");
     }
     </script>
     ```

104. ### What are the steps involved in return false usage?
     The return false statement in event handlers performs the below steps,

     1. First it stops the browser's default action or behaviour.
     2. It prevents the event from propagating the DOM
     3. Stops callback execution and returns immediately when called.

105. ### What is BOM?
     The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser. It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children of window. The Browser Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.

106. ### What is the use of setTimeout?
     The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,
     ```javascript
     setTimeout(function(){ console.log("Good morning"); }, 2000);
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

107. ### What is the use of setInterval?
     The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,
     ```javascript
     setInterval(function(){ console.log("Good morning"); }, 2000);
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

108. ### Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded?
     JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

109. ### What is an event delegation?
     Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.

     For example, if you wanted to detect field changes in inside a specific form, you can use event delegation technique,

     ```javascript
     var form = document.querySelector('#registration-form');

     // Listen for changes to fields inside the form
     form.addEventListener('input', function (event) {

     	// Log the field that was changed
     	console.log(event.target);

     }, false);
     ```

117. ### What is the purpose of clearTimeout method?
     The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been set by setTimeout()function before that. i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it‚Äôs passed into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer.

     For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3 seconds. This timeout can be cleared by clearTimeout() method.

     ```javascript
     <script>
     var msg;
     function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
     }
     function start() {
       msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);

     }

     function stop() {
         clearTimeout(msg);
     }
     </script>
     ```

118. ### What is the purpose of clearInterval method?
     The clearInterval() function is used in javascript to clear the interval which has been set by setInterval() function. i.e, The return value returned by setInterval() function is stored in a variable and it‚Äôs passed into the clearInterval() function to clear the interval.

     For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. This interval can be cleared by clearInterval() method.

     ```javascript
     <script>
     var msg;
     function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
     }
     function start() {
       msg = setInterval(greeting, 3000);

     }

137. ### How do you assign default values to variables?
     You can use the logical or operator `||` in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,
     ```javascript
     var a = b || c;
     ```
     As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

145. ### What are the benefits of keeping declarations at the top?
     It is recommended to keep all declarations at the top of each script or function. The benefits of doing this are,
     1. Gives cleaner code
     2. It provides a single place to look for local variables
     3. Easy to avoid unwanted global variables
     4. It reduces the possibility of unwanted re-declarations

149. ### How do you generate random integers?
     You can use Math.random() with Math.floor() to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,
     ```javascript
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;     // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;     // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
     ```
     **Note:** Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive),  and 1 (exclusive)

151. ### What is tree shaking?
     Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`.

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

152. ### What is the need of tree shaking?
     Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around  few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is been implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.

156. ### What are modifiers in regular expression?
     Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive and global searches. Let's list down some of the modifiers,

     | Modifier | Description |
     |---- | ---------
     | i  | Perform case-insensitive matching |
     | g | 	Perform a global match rather than stops at first match  |
     | m | Perform multiline matching|

    Let's take an example of global modifier,
    ```javascript
      var text = "Learn JS one by one";
      var pattern = /one/g;
      var result = text.match(pattern); // one,one
    ```

157. ### What are regular expression patterns?
     Regular Expressions provided group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,
     1. **Brackets:** These are used to find a range of characters.
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. [abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
        2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
        3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
     2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. \d: Used to find a digit
        2. \s: Used to find a whitespace character
        3. \b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
     3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
        2. n*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
        3. n?: Used to find	matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

178. ### What is a freeze method?
     The **freeze()** method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does'nt allow adding new properties to an object,prevents from removing and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e, It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.
     ```javascript
     const obj = {
       prop: 100
     };

     Object.freeze(obj);
     obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

     console.log(obj.prop); //100
     ```
     **Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

179. ### What is the purpose of freeze method?
     Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,

     1. It is used for freezing objects and arrays.
     2. It is used to make an object immutable.

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

180. ### Why do I need to use freeze method?
     In Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current context. Hence it works as `final` keyword which is used in various languages.

But values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable. Let's see the below example to understand more about seal() method
     ```javascript
      const object = {
         property: 'Welcome JS world'
      };
      Object.seal(object);
      object.property = 'Welcome to object world';

214. ### What is an anonymous function?
     An anonymous function is a function without a name! Anonymous functions are commonly assigned to a variable name or used as a callback function. The syntax would be as below,
     ```javascript
     function (optionalParameters) {
       //do something
     }

     const myFunction = function(){ //Anonymous function assigned to a variable
       //do something
     };

     [1, 2, 3].map(function(element){ //Anonymous function used as a callback function
       //do something
     });
     ```
     Let's see the above anonymous function in an example,
     ```javascript
     var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};
     var z = x(5, 10);
     console.log(z); // 50
     ```
     - They could have names which is necessary for a recursive function

216. ### What are javascript accessors?
     ECMAScript 5 introduced javascript object accessors or computed properties through getters and setters. Getters uses `get` keyword whereas Setters uses `set` keyword.
     ```javascript
     var user = {
       firstName: "John",
       lastName : "Abraham",
       language : "en",
       get lang() {
         return this.language;
       }
       set lang(lang) {
       this.language = lang;
       }
     };
     console.log(user.lang); // getter access lang as en
     user.lang = 'fr';
     console.log(user.lang); // setter used to set lang as fr
     ```

219. ### What are the advantages of Getters and Setters?
     Below are the list of benefits of Getters and Setters,
     1. They provide simpler syntax
     2. They are used for defining computed properties, or accessors in JS.
     3. Useful to provide equivalence relation between properties and methods
     4. They can provide better data quality
     5. Useful for doing things behind the scenes with the encapsulated logic.

225. ### What are the function parameter rules?
     JavaScript functions follow below rules for parameters,
     1. The function definitions do not specify data types for parameters.
     2. Do not perform type checking on the passed arguments.
     3. Do not check the number of arguments received.
     i.e, The below function follows the above rules,
     ```javascript
     function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
       console.log(parameter1); // 1
     }
     functionName(1);
     ```

226. ### What is an error object?
     An error object is a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs. It has two properties: name and message. For example, the below function logs error details,
     ```javascript
     try {
       greeting("Welcome");
     }
     catch(err) {
       console.log(err.name + "<br>" + err.message);
     }
     ```

229. ### What are the various statements in error handling?
     Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,
     1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors
     2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error
     3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors.
     4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

231. ### What is nodejs?
     Node.js is a server-side platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. It is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

234. ### What is an Iterator?
     An iterator is an object which defines a sequence and a return value upon its termination. It implements the Iterator protocol with a `next()` method which returns an object with two properties: `value` (the next value in the sequence) and `done` (which is true if the last value in the sequence has been consumed).

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

234. ### How does synchronous iteration works?
     Synchronous iteration was introduced in ES6 and it works with below set of components,

     **Iterable:** It is an object which can be iterated over via a method whose key is Symbol.iterator.
     **Iterator:** It is an object returned by invoking `[Symbol.iterator]()` on an iterable. This iterator object wraps each iterated element in an object and returns it via `next()` method one by one.
     **IteratorResult:** It is an object returned by `next()` method. The object contains two properties; the `value` property contains an iterated element and the `done` property  determines whether the element is last element or not.

     Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below,

     ```js
     const iterable = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
     const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
     console.log(iterator.next());  // { value: 'one', done: false }
     console.log(iterator.next());  // { value: 'two', done: false }
     console.log(iterator.next());  // { value: 'three', done: false }
     console.log(iterator.next());  // { value: 'undefined, done: true }
     ```

235. ### What is an event loop?
     The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until async function has finished executing the code.
     **Note:** It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations even though JavaScript is single-threaded.

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

236. ### What is call stack?
     Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreter to keeps track of function calls in the program. It has two major actions,
     1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.
     2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.

238. ### What is a decorator?
     A decorator is an expression that evaluates to a function and that takes the target, name, and decorator descriptor as arguments. Also, it optionally returns a decorator descriptor to install on the target object. Let's define admin decorator for user class at design time,
     ```javascript
     function admin(isAdmin) {
        return function(target) {
            target.isAdmin = isAdmin;
        }
     }

     @admin(true)
     class User() {
     }
     console.log(User.isAdmin); //true

      @admin(false)
      class User() {
      }
      console.log(User.isAdmin); //false
     ```

250. ### What is typescript?
    TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular is built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language.
    You can install it globally as
    ```
    npm install -g typescript
    ```
    Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,
    ```typescript
    function greeting(person: string) {
        return "Hello, " + person;
    }

    let user = "Sudheer";

    document.body.innerHTML = greeting(user);
    ```
    The greeting method allows only string type as argument.

252. ### What are the advantages of typescript over javascript?
     Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,
     1. TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it make sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is interpreted language.
     2. TypeScript is is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.
     3. TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.

256. ### How do you call the constructor of a parent class?
     You can use `super` keyword to call the constructor of a parent class. Remember that `super()` must be called before using 'this' reference. Otherwise it will cause a reference error. Let's see the usage of it,
     ```javascript
     class Square extends Rectangle {
       constructor(length) {
         super(length, length);
         this.name = 'Square';
       }

       get area() {
         return this.width * this.height;
       }

       set area(value) {
         this.area = value;
       }
     }
     ```

265. ### What Is Obfuscation in javascript?
     Obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating obfuscated javascript code(i.e, source or machine code) that is difficult for humans to understand. It is something similar to encryption, but a machine can understand the code and execute it.
     Let's see the below function before Obfuscation,
     ```javascript
     function greeeting() {
        console.log('Hello, welcome to JS world');
     }
     ```
     And after the code Obfuscation, it would be appeared as below,
     ```javascript
     eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return c};if(!''.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--){d[c]=k[c]||c}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function(){return'\\w+'};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new RegExp('\\b'+e(c)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('2 1(){0.3(\'4, 7 6 5 8\')}',9,9,'console|greeeting|function|log|Hello|JS|to|welcome|world'.split('|'),0,{}))
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

266. ### Why do you need Obfuscation?
     Below are the few reasons for Obfuscation,
     1. The Code size will be reduced. So data transfers between server and client will be fast.
     2. It hides the business logic from outside world and protects the code from others
     3. Reverse engineering is highly difficult
     4. The download time will be reduced

271. ### How do you perform form validation using javascript?
     JavaScript can be used to perform HTML form validation. For example, if form field is empty, the function needs to notify, and return false, to prevent the form being submitted.
     Lets' perform user login in an html form,
     ```html
     <form name="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
     User name: <input type="text" name="uname">
     <input type="submit" value="Submit">
     </form>
     ```
     And the validation on user login is below,
     ```javascript
     function validateForm() {
       var x = document.forms["myForm"]["uname"].value;
       if (x == "") {
         alert("The username shouldn't be empty");
         return false;
       }
     }
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

272. ### How do you perform form validation without javascript?
     You can perform HTML form validation automatically without using javascript. The validation enabled by applying `required` attribute to prevent form submission when the input is empty.
     ```html
     <form method="post">
       <input type="text" name="uname" required>
       <input type="submit" value="Submit">
     </form>
     ```
     **Note:** Automatic form validation does not work in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

273. ### What are the DOM methods available for constraint validation?
     The below DOM methods are available for constraint validation on an invalid input,
     1. checkValidity(): It returns true if an input element contains valid data.
     2. setCustomValidity(): It is used to set the validationMessage property of an input element.
     Let's take an user login form with DOM validations
     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
       var userName = document.getElementById("uname");
       if (!userName.checkValidity()) {
         document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = userName.validationMessage;
       } else {
         document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "Entered a valid username";
       }
     }
     ```

277. ### Is enums feature available in javascript?
     No, javascript does not natively support enums. But there are different kind of solutions to simulate them even though they may not provide exact equivalent. For example, you can use freeze or seal on object,
     ```javascript
     var DaysEnum = Object.freeze({"monday":1, "tuesday":2, "wednesday":3, ...})
     ```

     enum Color {
     	RED, GREEN, BLUE
     }
     ```

282. ### How do you extend classes?
     The `extends` keyword is used in class declarations/expressions to create a class which is a child of another class. It can be used to subclass custom classes as well as built-in objects. The syntax would be as below,
     ```javascript
     class ChildClass extends ParentClass { ... }
     ```
     Let's take an example of Square subclass from Polygon parent class,
     ```javascript
      class Square extends Rectangle {
        constructor(length) {
          super(length, length);
          this.name = 'Square';
        }

        get area() {
          return this.width * this.height;
        }

        set area(value) {
          this.area = value;
        }
      }
     ```

283. ### How do I modify the url without reloading the page?
     The `window.localtion.url` property will be helpful to modify the url but it reloads the page. HTML5 introduced the `history.pushState()` and `history.replaceState()` methods, which allow you to add and modify history entries, respectively. For example, you can use pushState as below,
     ```javascript
     window.history.pushState('page2', 'Title', '/page2.html');
     ```

286. ### How to get the value from get parameters?
     The `new URL()` object accepts url string and `searchParams` property of this object can be used to access the get parameters. Remember that you may need to use polyfill or `window.location` to access the URL in older browsers(including IE).
     ```javascript
     let urlString = "http://www.some-domain.com/about.html?x=1&y=2&z=3"; //window.location.href
     let url = new URL(urlString);
     let parameterZ = url.searchParams.get("z");
     console.log(parameterZ); // 3

288. ### What is the difference between java and javascript?
     Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation between them. Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. Whereas Javascript is dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a browser and nodejs environments. Let's see the major differences in a tabular format,
     | Feature | Java | JavaScript |
     |---- | ---------
     | Typed  | It's a strongly typed language | It's a dynamic typed language |
     | Paradigm | Object oriented programming  | Prototype based programming |
     | Scoping | Block scoped | Function-scoped |
     | Concurrency | Thread based | event based |
     | Memory | Uses more memory | Uses less memory. Hence it will be used for web pages |

     If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you need to start with accessing the document object. Later you can use any of the below methods to find the HTML element,
     1. document.getElementById(id): It finds an element by Id
     2. document.getElementsByTagName(name): It finds an element by tag name
     3. document.getElementsByClassName(name): It finds an element by class name

295. ### What is jQuery?
     jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of ‚ÄúWrite less, do more‚Äù. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,
     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function(){ // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
         alert('Welcome to jQuery world');
     });
     ```
     **Note:** You can download it from jquery official site or install it from CDNs, like google.

     V8 is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine used by the Google Chrome browser, written in C++. It is also being used in the node.js project. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.
     **Note:** It can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

297. ### Why do we call javascript as dynamic language?
     JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/re-assigned with values of all types.
     ```javascript
     let age = 50;    // age is a number now
     age  = 'old'; // age is a string now
     age  = true;  // age is a boolean
     ```

300. ### How do you create an infinite loop?
     You can create infinite loop using for and while loops without using any expressions. The for loop construct or syntax is better approach in terms of ESLint and code optimizer tools,
     ```javascript
     for (;;) {}
     while(true) {
     }
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

301. ### Why do you need to avoid with statement?
     JavaScript's with statement was intended to provide a shorthand for writing recurring accesses to objects. So it can help reduce file size by reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty. Let's take an example where it is used to avoid redundancy when accessing an object several times.
     ```javascript
     a.b.c.greeting   = 'welcome';
     a.b.c.age = 32;
     ```
     Using `with` it turns this into:
     ```javascript
     with(a.b.c) {
             greeting   = "welcome";
             age = 32;
     }
     ```
     But this `with` statement creates performance problems since one cannot predict whether argument will refer to a real variable or to a property inside the with argument.

302. ### What is the output of below for loops?
     ```javascript
     for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) { // global scope
       setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
     }

     for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) { // block scope
       setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
     }
     ```
     The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3
     **Explanation:** Due to event queue/loop of javascript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i is declared with `var` keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time setTimeout function is invoked. Hence, the output of the first loop is `4 4 4 4`. Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as `let` keyword it became a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is `0 1 2 3`.

305. ### Can I redeclare let and const variables?
     No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws below error
     ```bash
     Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declared
     ```
     **Explanation:** The variable declaration with `var` keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the same scope for both var and let/const variables.
     ```javascript
     var name = 'John';
     function myFunc() {
         var name = 'Nick';
         var name = 'Abraham'; // Re-assigned in the same function block
         alert(name); // Abraham
     }
     myFunc();
     alert(name); // John
     ```
     The block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,
     ```javascript
     let name = 'John';
     function myFunc() {
         let name = 'Nick';
         let name = 'Abraham'; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
         alert(name);
     }

     myFunc();
     alert(name);
     ```

306. ### Is const variable makes the value immutable?
     No, the const variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)
     ```javascript
     const userList = [];
     userList.push('John'); // Can mutate even though it can't re-assign
     console.log(userList); // ['John']
     ```

307. ### What are default parameters?
     In E5, we need to depends on logical OR operator to handle default values of function parameters. Whereas in ES6, Default function parameters feature allows parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed. Let's compare the behavior with an examples,
     ```javascript
     //ES5
     var calculateArea = function(height, width) {
        height =  height || 50;
        width = width || 60;

        return width * height;
     }
     console.log(calculateArea()); //300
     ```
     The default parameters makes the initialization more simpler,
     ```javascript
     //ES6
     var calculateArea = function(height = 50, width = 60) {
        return width * height;
     }

     console.log(calculateArea()); //300
     ```

308. ### What are template literals?
     Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (` `) character instead of double or single quotes.
     In E6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,
     ```javascript
     var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`
     ```
     In ES5, you need break string like below,
     ```javascript
     var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`
     ```
     **Note:** You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals.

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

309. ### How do you write multi-line strings in template literals?
     In ES5, you would have to use newline escape character('\n') and concatenation symbol(+) in order to get multi-line strings.
     ```javascript
     console.log('This is string sentence 1\n' +
     'This is string sentence 2');
     ```
     Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,
     ```javascript
     console.log(`This is string sentence
     'This is string sentence 2`);
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

310. ### What are nesting templates?
     The nesting templates is a feature supported with in template literals syntax to allow inner backticks inside a placeholder ${ } within the template. For example, the below nesting template is used to display the icons based on user permissions whereas outer template checks for platform type,
     ```javascript
     const iconStyles = `icon ${ isMobilePlatform() ? '' :
      `icon-${user.isAuthorized ? 'submit' : 'disabled'}` }`;
     ```
     You can write the above usecase without nesting template feature as well. However, nesting template feature is more compact and readable.
     ```javascript
     //Without nesting templates
      const iconStyles = `icon ${ isMobilePlatform() ? '' :
       (user.isAuthorized ? 'icon-submit' : 'icon-disabled'}`;
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

311. ### What are tagged templates?
     Tagged templates are the advanced form of templates in which tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The tag function accepts first parameter as array of strings and remaining parameters as expressions. This function can also return manipulated string based on parameters. Let's see the usage of this tagged template behavior of an IT professional skill set in an organization,
     ```javascript
     var user1 = 'John';
     var skill1 = 'JavaScript';
     var experience1 = 15;

     var user2 = 'Kane';
     var skill2 = 'JavaScript';
     var experience2 = 5;

     function myInfoTag(strings, userExp, experienceExp, skillExp) {
       var str0 = strings[0]; // "Mr/Ms. "
       var str1 = strings[1]; // " is a/an "
       var str2 = strings[2]; // "in"

       var expertiseStr;
       if (experienceExp > 10){
         expertiseStr = 'expert developer';
       } else if(skillExp > 5 && skillExp <= 10) {
         expertiseStr = 'senior developer';
       } else {
         expertiseStr = 'junior developer';
       }

       return `${str0}${userExp}${str1}${experienceExp}{str3}`;
     }

     var output1 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${ user1 } is a/an ${ experience1 } in ${skill1}`;
     var output2 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${ user2 } is a/an ${ experience2 } in ${skill2}`;

     console.log(output1);// Mr/Ms. John is a/an expert developer in JavaScript
     console.log(output2);// Mr/Ms. Kane is a/an junior developer in JavaScript
     ```

312. ### What are raw strings?
     ES6 provides raw strings feature using `String.raw()` method which is used to get the raw string form of template strings. This feature allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,
     ```javascript
     var calculationString = String.raw `The sum of numbers is \n${1+2+3+4}!`;
     console.log(calculationString); // The sum of numbers is 10
     ```
     If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will be processed by displaying the output in multiple lines
     ```
      var calculationString = `The sum of numbers is \n${1+2+3+4}!`;
      console.log(calculationString);
      // The sum of numbers is
      // 10
     ```
     Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag function
     ```javascript
     function tag(strings) {
       console.log(strings.raw[0]);
     }
     ```

313. ### What is destructuring assignment?
     The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
     Let's get the month values from an array using destructuring assignment
     ```javascript
     var [one, two, three] = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MARCH'];

     console.log(one); // "JAN"
     console.log(two); // "FEB"
     console.log(three); // "MARCH"
     ```
     and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,
     ```javascript
     var {name, age} = {name: 'John', age: 32};

     console.log(name); // John
     console.log(age); // 32
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

314. ### What are default values in destructuring assignment?
     A variable can be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment. Let's take an example for both arrays and object usecases,

     **Arrays destructuring:**
     ```javascript
     var x, y, z;

     [x=2, y=4, z=6] = [10];
     console.log(x); // 10
     console.log(y); // 4
     console.log(z); // 6
     ```
     **Objects destructuring:**
     ```javascript
     var {x=2, y=4, z=6} = {x: 10};

     console.log(x); // 10
     console.log(y); // 4
     console.log(z); // 6
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

315. ### How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment?
     If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable. Whereas using destructuring feature, two variables values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. Let's swap two number variables in array destructuring assignment,
     ```javascript
     var x = 10, y = 20;

     [x, y] = [y, x];
     console.log(x); // 20
     console.log(y); // 10
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

316. ### What are enhanced object literals?
     Object literals make it easy to quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces. For example, it provides shorter syntax for common object property definition as below.
     ```javascript
     //ES6
     var x = 10, y = 20
     obj = { x, y }
     console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}
     //ES5
     var x = 10, y = 20
     obj = { x : x, y : y}
     console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}
     ```

317. ### What are dynamic imports?
     The dynamic imports using `import()` function syntax allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax. Currently this features is in stage4 proposal(https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import). The main advantage of dynamic imports is reduction of our bundle's sizes, the size/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the user experience.
     The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,
     ```javascript
     import('./Module').then(Module => Module.method());
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

318. ### What are the use cases for dynamic imports?
     Below are some of the use cases of using dynamic imports over static imports,
     1. Import a module on-demand or conditionally. For example, if you want to load a polyfill on legacy browser
     ```javascript
     if (isLegacyBrowser()) {
         import(¬∑¬∑¬∑)
         .then(¬∑¬∑¬∑);
     }
     ```
     2. Compute the module specifier at runtime. For example, you can use it for internationalization.
     ```javascript
     import(`messages_${getLocale()}.js`).then(¬∑¬∑¬∑);
     ```
     3. Import a module from within a regular script instead a module.

319. ### What are typed arrays?
     Typed arrays are array-like objects from ECMAScript 6 API for handling binary data. JavaScript provides 8 Typed array types,

     1. Int8Array: An array of 8-bit signed integers
     2. Int16Array: An array of 16-bit signed integers
     3. Int32Array: An array of 32-bit signed integers
     4. Uint8Array: An array of 8-bit unsigned integers
     5. Uint16Array: An array of 16-bit unsigned integers
     6. Uint32Array: An array of 32-bit unsigned integers
     7. Float32Array: An array of 32-bit floating point numbers
     8. Float64Array: An array of 64-bit floating point numbers

     For example, you can create an array of 8-bit signed integers as below

     ```javascript
     const a = new Int8Array();
     // You can pre-allocate n bytes
     const bytes = 1024
     const a = new Int8Array(bytes)
     ```

320. ### What are the advantages of module loaders?
     The module loaders provides the below features,
     1. Dynamic loading
     2. State isolation
     3. Global namespace isolation
     4. Compilation hooks
     4. Nested virtualization

321. ### What is collation?
     Collation is used for sorting a set of strings and searching within a set of strings. It is parameterized by locale and aware of Unicode. Let's take comparision and sorting features,
     1. **Comparison:**
     ```javascript
     var list = [ "√§", "a", "z" ]; // In German,  "√§" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "√§" sorts after "z"
     var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
     var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
     console.log(l10nDE.compare("√§", "z") === -1); // true
     console.log(l10nSV.compare("√§", "z") === +1); // true
     ```
     2. **Sorting:**
     ```javascript
     var list = [ "√§", "a", "z" ]; // In German,  "√§" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "√§" sorts after "z"
     var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
     var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
     console.log(list.sort(l10nDE.compare)) // [ "a", "√§", "z" ]
     console.log(list.sort(l10nSV.compare)) // [ "a", "z", "√§" ]
     ```

322. ### What is for...of statement?
     The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects or elements such as built-in String, Array, Array-like objects (like arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. The basic usage of for...of statement on arrays would be as below,
     ```javascript
     let arrayIterable = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

     for (let value of arrayIterable) {
       value ++;
       console.log(value); // 11 21 31 41 51
     }
     ```

323. ### What is the output of below spread operator array?
     ```javascript
     [...'John Resig']
     ```
     The output of the array is ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', '', 'R', 'e', 's', 'i', 'g']
     **Explanation:** The string is an iterable type and the spread operator with in an array maps every character of an iterable to one element. Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array.

324. ### Is PostMessage secure?
     Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer/developer is careful about checking the origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send/receive a message without verifying its source will create cross-site scripting attacks.

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

325. ### What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard?
     The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the wildcard ‚Äú*‚Äù as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
     ```javascript
     targetWindow.postMessage(message, '*');
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

326. ### How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers?
     Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker‚Äôs origin,  which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender‚Äôs window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using ‚Äúmessage.origin‚Äù attribute. For examples, let's check the sender's origin(http://www.some-sender.com) on receiver side(www.some-receiver.com),
     ```javascript
     //Listener on http://www.some-receiver.com/
     window.addEventListener("message", function(message){
         if(/^http://www\.some-sender\.com$/.test(message.origin)){
              console.log('You recieved the data from valid sender', message.data);
        }
     });
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

327. ### Can I avoid using postMessages completely?
     You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your application doesn‚Äôt use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge.

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

328. ### Is postMessages synchronous?
     The postMessages are synchronous in IE8 browser but they are asynchronous in IE9 and all other modern browsers (i.e, IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).Due to this asynchronous behaviour, we use a callback mechanism when the postMessage is returned.

330. ### What is the difference between internal and external javascript?
     **Internal JavaScript:** It is the source code with in the script tag.
     **External JavaScript:** The source code is stored in an external file(stored with .js extension) and referred with in the tag.

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

331. ### Is JavaScript faster than server side script?
     Yes, JavaScript is than server side script. Because JavaScript is a client-side script it does require any web server‚Äôs help for its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.

332. ### How do you get the status of a checkbox?
     You can apply `checked` property on selected checkbox in the DOM. If the value is `True` means the checkbox is checked otherwise it is unchecked. For example, the below HTML checkbox element can be access using javascript as below,
     ```html
       <input type="checkbox" name="checkboxname" value="Agree"> Agree the conditions<br>
     ```
     ```javascript
     console.log(document.getElementById(‚Äòcheckboxname‚Äô).checked); // true or false

333. ### What is the purpose of double tilde operator?
     The double tilde operator(~~) is known as double NOT bitwise operator. This operator is going to be a quicker substitute for Math.floor().

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

334. ### How do you convert character to ASCII code?
     You can use `String.prototype.charCodeAt()` method to convert string characters to ASCII numbers. For example, let's find ASCII code for the first letter of 'ABC' string,
     ```javascript
     "ABC".charCodeAt(0) // returns 65
     ```
     Whereas `String.fromCharCode()` method to convert numbers to equal ASCII character.
     ```javascript
     String.fromCharCode(65,66,67); // returns 'ABC'
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

335. ### What is ArrayBuffer?
     An ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer. You can create it as below,
     ```javascript
     let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // create a buffer of length 16
     alert(buffer.byteLength); // 16
     ```
     To manipulate an ArrayBuffer, we need to use a ‚Äúview‚Äù object.
     ```javascript
     //Create a DataView referring to the buffer
      let view = new DataView(buffer);
     ```

336. ### What is the output of below string expression?
     ```javascript
     console.log("Welcome to JS world"[0])
     ```
     The output of the above expression is "W".
     **Explanation:** The bracket notation with specific index on a string returns the character at a specific location. Hence, it returns character "W" of the string. Since this is not supported in IE7 and below versions, you may need to use .charAt() method to get the desired result.

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

337. ### What is the purpose of Error object?
     The Error constructor creates an error object and the instances of error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. The syntax of error object would be as below,
     ```javascript
     new Error([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
     ```
     You can throw user defined exceptions or errors using Error object in try...catch block as below,
     ```javascript
     try {
       if(withdraw > balance)
       throw new Error('Oops! You don't have enough balance');
     } catch (e) {
       console.log(e.name + ': ' + e.message);
     }
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

338. ### What is the purpose of EvalError object?
     The EvalError object indicates an error regarding the global `eval()` function. Even though this exception is not thrown by JavaScript anymore, the EvalError object remains for compatibility. The syntax of this expression would be as below,
     ```javascript
     new EvalError([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
     ```
     You can throw EvalError with in try...catch block as below,
     ```javascript
     try {
       throw new EvalError('Eval function error', 'someFile.js', 100);
     } catch (e) {
       console.log(e.message, e.name, e.fileName);              // "Eval function error", "EvalError", "someFile.js"
     ```

339. ### What are the list of cases error thrown from non-strict mode to strict mode?
     When you apply 'use strict'; syntax, some of the below cases will throw a SyntaxError before executing the script
     1. When you use Octal syntax
     ```javascript
     var n = 022;
     ```
     2. Using `with` statement
     3. When you use delete operator on a variable name
     4. Using eval or arguments as variable or function argument name
     5. When you use newly reserved keywords
     6. When you declare a function in a block
     ```javascript
     if (someCondition) { function f() {} }
     ```
     Hence, the errors from above cases helpful to avoid errors in development/production environments.

341. ### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
     Parameter is the variable name of a function definition whereas an argument represent the value given to a function when it is invoked. Let's explain this with a simple function
     ```javascript
     function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
       console.log(arguments[0]) // "argument1"
       console.log(arguments[1]) // "argument2"
       console.log(arguments[2]) // "argument3"
     }
     myFunction("argument1", "argument2", "argument3")
     ```

342. ### What is the purpose of some method in arrays?
     The some() method is used to test whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. The method returns a boolean value. Let's take an example to test for any odd elements,
     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ,7, 8, 9, 10];

     var odd = element ==> element % 2 !== 0;

     console.log(array.some(odd)); // true (the odd element exists)
     ```

     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

343. ### How do you combine two or more arrays?
     The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays by returning a new array containing all the elements. The syntax would be as below,
     ```javascript
     array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayX)
     ```
     Let's take an example of array's concatenation with veggies and fruits arrays,
     ```javascript
       var veggies = ["Tomato", "Carrot", "Cabbage"];
       var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pears"];
       var veggiesAndFruits = veggies.concat(fruits);
       console.log(veggiesAndFruits); // Tomato, Carrot, Cabbage, Apple, Orange, Pears

      There are two ways to copy an object,

      **Shallow Copy:**
      Shallow copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.

      ### Example
      ```
      var empDetails = {
        name: "John", age: 25, expertise: "Software Developer"
      }
      ```
      to create a duplicate
      ```
      var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails    //Shallow copying!
      ```
      if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:

      ```
      empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson"
      ```

      The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're loosing the original data as well.

      **Deep copy:**
      A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.
      ### Example
      ```
      var empDetails = {
        name: "John", age: 25, expertise: "Software Developer"
      }
      ```
      Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable

      ```
      var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
        name: empDetails.name,
        age: empDetails.age,
        expertise: empDetails.expertise
      }
      ```
      Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`

345. ### How do you create specific number of copies of a string?
     The `repeat()` method is used to construct and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method has been added to the ECMAScript 2015 specification.
     Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,
     ```javascript
     'Hello'.repeat(4);  // 'HelloHelloHelloHello'
     ```
346. ### How do you return all matching strings against a regular expression?
     The `matchAll()` method can be used to return an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression. For example, the below example returns an array of matching string results against a regular expression,
     ```javascript
     let regexp = /Hello(\d?))/g;
     let greeting = 'Hello1Hello2Hello3';

     let greetingList = [...greeting.matchAll(regexp)];

     console.log(greetingList[0]); //Hello1
     console.log(greetingList[1]); //Hello2
     console.log(greetingList[2]); //Hello3
     ```

347. ### How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending?
     The `trim` method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use `trimStart/trimLeft` and `trimEnd/trimRight` methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,
     ```javascript
     var greeting = '   Hello, Goodmorning!   ';

     console.log(greeting); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!   "
     console.log(greeting.trimStart()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "
     console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "

     console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
     console.log(greeting.trimRight()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
     ```

348. ### What is the output of below console statement with unary operator?
     Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,
     ```javascript
     console.log(+ 'Hello');
     ```
     The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.

350. ### What is a thunk function?
     A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn‚Äôt take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,
     ```javascript
     const add = (x,y) => x + y;

     const thunk = () => add(2,3);

     thunk() // 5
     ```
     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

351. ### What are asynchronous thunks?
     The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests.  Let's see an example of network requests,
     ```javascript
     function fetchData(fn){
       fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(json => fn(json))
     }


     const asyncThunk = function (){
        return fetchData(function getData(data){
           console.log(data)
       })
     }

     asyncThunk()
     ```
     The `getData` function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.

352. ### What is the output of below function calls?
     **Code snippet:**
     const circle = {
       radius: 20,
       diameter() {
         return this.radius * 2;
       },
       perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius
     };

     console.log(circle.diameter());
     console.log(circle.perimeter());

     **Output:**

     The output is 40 and NaN. Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The this keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter function refers the surrounding scope which is window object. Since there is no radius property on window object it returns an undefined value and the multiple of number value returns NaN value.

353. ### How to remove all line breaks from a string?
     The easiest approach is using regular expressions to detect and replace newlines in the string. In this case, we use replace function along with string to replace with, which in our case is an empty string.
     ```javascript
     function remove_linebreaks( var message ) {
         return message.replace( /[\r\n]+/gm, "" );
     }
     ```
     In the above expression, g and m are for global and multiline flags.

354. ### What is the difference between reflow and repaint?
     A *repaint* occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout. Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A *reflow* involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow. Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements following it in the DOM.

355. ### What happens with negating an array?
     Negating an array with `!` character will coerce the array into a boolean. Since Arrays are considered to be truthy So negating it will return `false`.
     ```javascript
     console.log(![]); // false
     ```
     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
356. ### What happens if we add two arrays?
     If you add two arrays together, it will convert them both to strings and concatenate them. For example, the result of adding arrays would be as below,
     ```javascript
     console.log(['a'] + ['b']);  // "ab"
     console.log([] + []); // ""
     console.log(![] + []); // "false", because ![] returns false.
     ```
     **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

357. ### What is the output of prepend additive operator on falsy values?
     If you prepend additive(+) operator on falsy values(null, undefined, NaN, false, ""), the falsy value converts to a number value zero. Let's display them on browser console as below,
     ```javascript
     console.log(+null); // 0
     console.log(+undefined);// 0
     console.log(+false); // 0
     console.log(+NaN); // 0
     console.log(+""); // 0
     ```

358. ### How do you create self string using special characters?
     The self string can be formed with the combination of `[]()!+` characters. You need to remember the below conventions to achieve this pattern.
     1. Since Arrays are truthful values, negating the arrays will produce false: ![] === false
     2. As per JavaScript coercing rules, the addition of arrays together will toString them: [] + [] === ""
     3. Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1

     By applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions
     ```javascript
     ![] + [] === "false"
     +!+[] === 1
     ```
     Now the character pattern would be created as below,

     ```javascript
           s               e               l               f
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      (![] + [])[3] + (![] + [])[4] + (![] + [])[2] + (![] + [])[0]
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +
     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +
     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]] +
     (![] + [])[+[]]
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     (![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+[]]
     ```

358. ### How do you remove falsy values from an array?
     You can apply filter method on array by passing Boolean as parameter. This way it removes all falsy values(0, undefined, null, false and "") from the array.
     ```javascript
     const myArray = [false, null, 1,5, undefined]
     myArray.filter(Boolean); // [1, 5] // is same as myArray.filter(x => x);
     ```

359. ### How do you get unique values of an array?
     You can get unique values of an array with the combination of `Set` and rest expression/spread(...) syntax.
     ```javascript
     console.log([...new Set([1, 2, 4, 4, 3])]); // [1, 2, 4, 3]
     ```

360. ### What is destructuring aliases?
     Sometimes you would like to have destructured variable with a different name than the property name. In that case, you'll use a `: newName` to specify a name for the variable. This process is called destructuring aliases.
     ```javascript
     const obj = { x: 1 };
     // Grabs obj.x as as { otherName }
     const { x: otherName } = obj;
     ```

361. ### How do you map the array values without using map method?
     You can map the array values without using `map` method by just using `from` method of Array. Let's map city names from Countries array,
     ```javascrippt
     const countries = [
         { name: 'India', capital: 'Delhi' },
         { name: 'US', capital: 'Washington' },
         { name: 'Russia', capital: 'Moscow' },
         { name: 'Singapore', capital: 'Singapore' },
         { name: 'China', capital: 'Beijing' },
         { name: 'France', capital: 'Paris' },
     ];

     const cityNames = Array.from(countries, ({ capital}) => capital);
     console.log(cityNames); // ['Delhi, 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'Singapore', 'Beijing', 'Paris']
     ```

374. ### How do you flattening multi dimensional arrays?
     Flattening bi-dimensional arrays is trivial with Spread operator.
     ```javascript
     const biDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, 55], [66, 77], 88, 99];
     const flattenArr = [].concat(...biDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
     ```
     But you can make it work with multi-dimensional arrays by recursive calls,

     ```javascript
     function flattenMultiArray(arr) {
         const flattened = [].concat(...arr);
         return flattened.some(item => Array.isArray(item)) ? flattenMultiArray(flattened) : flattened;
      }
     const multiDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]];
     const flatArr = flattenMultiArray(multiDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]

378. ### What are wrapper objects?
     Primitive Values like string,number and boolean don't have properties and methods but they are temporarily converted or coerce to an object(Wrapper object) when you try to perform actions on them. For example, if you apply toUpperCase() method on a primitive string value, it does not throw an error but returns uppercase of the string.
     ```javascript
     let name = "john";

     console.log(name.toUpperCase());  // Behind the scenes treated as console.log(new String(name).toUpperCase());
     ```
     i.e, Every primitive except null and undefined have Wrapper Objects and the list of wrapper objects are are String,Number,Boolean,Symbol and BigInt.

381. ### How to cancel a fetch request?
     Until few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new `AbortController` from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls.
     The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,
     1. Create an `AbortController` instance
     2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal
     3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal
     For example, let's pass the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,
     ```js
     const controller = new AbortController();
     const { signal } = controller;

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal }).then(response => {
         console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);
     }).catch(e => {
         if(e.name === "AbortError") {
             // We know it's been canceled!
         }
     });

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal }).then(response => {
         console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);
     }).catch(e => {
          if(e.name === "AbortError") {
              // We know it's been canceled!
           }
     });

     // Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests
     setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);

382. ### What is web speech API?
     Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API has been introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts,
     1. **SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by `SpeechRecognition` interface.
     The below example shows on how to use this API to get text from speech,
     ```js
     window.SpeechRecognition = window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition;  // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF
     const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
     recognition.onresult = (event) => { // SpeechRecognitionEvent type
       const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;
       console.log(speechToText);
     }
     recognition.start();
     ```
     In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone
     2. **SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by `SpeechSynthesis` interface.
     For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,
     ```js
     if('speechSynthesis' in window){
         var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Hello World!');
         speech.lang = 'en-US';
         window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
     }
     ```
     The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.
     **Note:**  This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)

383. ### What is minimum timeout throttling?
     Both browser and NodeJS javascript environments, throttles with a minimum delay that is greater than 0ms. That means even though setting a delay of 0ms will not happen instantaneously.
     **Browsers:** They have minimum delay of 4ms. This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting(certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals.
     Note: The older browsers has minimum delay of 10ms.
     **Nodejs:** They have minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1.
     The best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet.
     ```js
     function runMeFirst() {
         console.log('My script is initialized');
     }
     setTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);
     console.log('Script loaded');
     ```
     and the output would be in
     ```cmd
     Script loaded
     My script is initialized
     ```
     If you don't use `setTimeout`, the order of logs will be in sequential.
     ```js
     function runMeFirst() {
        console.log('My script is initialized');
     }
     runMeFirst();
     console.log('Script loaded');
     ```
     and the output is,
     ```cmd
     My script is initialized
     Script loaded
     ```

384. ### How do you implement zero timeout in modern browsers?
     You can't use setTimeout(fn, 0) to execute the code immediately due to minimum delay of greater than 0ms. But you can use window.postMessage() to achieve this behavior.

385. ### What are tasks in event loop?
     A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these tasks are schedules on task queue.
     Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,
     1. When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or running by the <script> element, the task will be added to task queue.
     2. When an event fires, the event callback added to task queue
     3. When a setTimeout or setInterval is reached, the corresponding callback added to task queue

386. ### What is microtask?
     Microtask is the javascript code which needs to be executed immediately after the currently executing task/microtask is completed. They are kind of blocking in nature. i.e, The main thread will be blocked until microtask queue is empty.
     The main sources of microtasks are Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, MutationObservers, IntersectionObservers etc

     **Note:** All of these microtasks are processed in the same turn of event loop.

389. ### How do you use javascript libraries in typescript file?
     It is known that not all JavaScript libraries or frameworks have TypeScript declaration files. But if you still want to use libraries or frameworks in our TypeScript files without getting compilation errors, the only solution is `declare` keyword along with a variable declaration. For example, let's imagine you have a library called `customLibrary` that doesn‚Äôt have a TypeScript declaration and have a namespace called `customLibrary` in the global namespace. You can use this library in typescript code as below,
     ```js
     declare var customLibrary;
     ```
     In the runtime, typescript will provide the type to `customLibrary` variable as `any` type. The another alternative without using declare keyword is below
     ```js
     var customLibrary: any;
     ```

390. ### What are the differences between promises and observables?
     Some of the major difference in a tabular form

     | Promises | Observables |
     |---- | ---------
     | Emits only a single value at a time  | Emits multiple values over a period of time(stream of values ranging from 0 to multiple) |
     | Eager in nature; they are going to be called immediately  | Lazy in nature; they require subscription to be invoked |
     | Promise is always asynchronous even though it resolved immediately | Observable can be either synchronous or asynchronous|
     | Doesn't provide any operators | Provides operators such as map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen etc |
     | Cannot be canceled | Canceled by using unsubscribe() method |

391. ### What is heap?
     Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime.
     Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.

392. ### What is an event table?
     Event Table is a data structure that stores and keeps track of all the events which will be executed asynchronously like after some time interval or after the resolution of some API requests. i.e Whenever you call a setTimeout function or invoke async operation, it is added to the Event Table.
     It doesn't not execute functions on it‚Äôs own. The main purpose of event table is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue as shown in the below diagram.

393. ### What is a microTask queue?
     Microtask Queue is the new queue where all the tasks initiated by promise objects get processed before the callback queue.
     The microtasks queue are processed before the next rendering and painting jobs. But if these microtasks are running for long time then it leads to visual degradation.

394. ### What is the difference between shim and polyfill?
     A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment.  It isn't necessarily restricted to a web application. For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9).
     Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.
     In a simple sentence, A polyfill is a shim for a browser API.

395. ### How do you detect primitive or non primitive value type?
     In JavaScript, primitive types include boolean, string, number, BigInt, null, Symbol and undefined. Whereas non-primitive types include the Objects. But you can easily identify them with the below function,
     ```js
     var myPrimitive = 30;
     var myNonPrimitive = {};
     function isPrimitive(val) {
         return Object(val) !== val;
     }

     isPrimitive(myPrimitive);
     isPrimitive(myNonPrimitive);
     ```
     If the value is a primitive data type, the Object constructor creates a new wrapper object for the value. But If the value is a non-primitive data type (an object), the Object constructor will give the same object.

     Babel is a JavaScript transpiler to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Some of the main features are listed below,
     1. Transform syntax
     2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (using @babel/polyfill)
     3. Source code transformations (or codemods)

397. ### Is Node.js completely single threaded?
     Node is single thread, but some of the functions included in the Node.js standard library(e.g, fs module functions) are not single threaded. i.e, Their logic runs outside of the Node.js single thread to improve the speed and peformance of a program.

400. ### What is the difference between Function constructor and function declaration?
     The functions which are created with `Function constructor` do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.

     Let's see this difference with an example,

     **Function Constructor:**
     ```js
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
         var a = 200;
         return new Function('return a;');
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 100
     ```
     **Function declaration:**
     ```js
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
         var a = 200;
         return function func() {
             return a;
         }
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 200
     ```

401. ### What is a Short circuit condition?
     Short circuit conditions are meant for condensed way of writing simple if statements. Let's demonstrate the scenario using an example. If you would like to login to a portal with an authentication condition, the expression would be as below,
     ```js
     if (authenticate) {
        loginToPorta();
     }
     ```
     Since the javascript logical operators evaluates from left to right, the above expression can be simplified using && logical operator
     ```js
     authenticate && loginToPorta();
     ```

402. ### What is the easiest way to resize an array?
     The length property of array is useful to resize or empty an array quickly. Let's apply length property on number array to resize the number of elements from 5 to 2,
     ```js
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     console.log(array.length); // 5

     array.length = 2;
     console.log(array.length); // 2
     console.log(array); // [1,2]
     ```
     and the array can be emptied too
     ```js
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     array.length = 0;
     console.log(array.length); // 0
     console.log(array); // []
     ```

403. ### What is an observable?
     An Observable is basically a function that can return a stream of values either synchronously or asynchronously to an observer over time. The consumer can get the value by calling `subscribe()` method.
     Let's look at a simple example of an Observable
     ```js
     import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

     const observable = new Observable(observer => {
       setTimeout(() => {
         observer.next('Message from a Observable!');
       }, 3000);
     });

     observable.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
     ```

404. ### What is the difference between function and class declarations?
     The main difference between function declarations and class declarations is `hoisting`. The function declarations are hoisted but not class declarations.
     **Classes:**
     ```js
     const user = new User(); // ReferenceError

     class User {}
     ```
     **Constructor Function:**
     ```js
      const user = new User(); // No error

      function User() {
      }
     ```

405. ### What is an async function?
     An async function is a function declared with the `async` keyword which enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more `await` expressions.

     Let's take a below async function example,

     ```js
     async function logger() {

       let data = await fetch('http://someapi.com/users'); // pause until fetch returns
       console.log(data)
     }
     logger();
     ```
     It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.

406. ### How do you prevent promises swallowing errors?
     While using asynchronous code, JavaScript‚Äôs ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.

     Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,

         ```js
         Promise.resolve('promised value').then(function() {
             throw new Error('error');
         });

         Promise.reject('error value').catch(function() {
             throw new Error('error');
         });

         new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
             throw new Error('error');
         });
         ```

        But there are many modern JavaScript environments won‚Äôt print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,

     1. **Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains

         ```js
         Promise.resolve('promised value').then(function() {
             throw new Error('error');
         }).catch(function(error) {
           console.error(error.stack);
         });
          ```

        But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.

     2. **Add done method:** You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method

         ```js
         Promise.resolve('promised value').done(function() {
             throw new Error('error');
         });
         ```

        Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulted data asynchronously. You can write `done` block as below,

         ```js
         getDataFromHttp()
           .then(function(result) {
             return processDataAsync(result);
           })
           .done(function(processed) {
             displayData(processed);
           });
         ```

         In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,

         ```js
          getDataFromHttp()
            .then(function(result) {
              return displayData(processDataAsync(result));
            })
         ```

         and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.

     3. **Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:**
         Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in second solution. This library has a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections

         ```js
         Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function(error){
             throw error;
         });
         ```

         and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch

         ```js
         Promise.reject('error value').catch(function() {});
         ```

408. ### How do you make an object iterable in javascript?
     By default, plain object is not iterable. But you can make the object iterable by defining a `Symbol.iterator` property on it.

     Let's demonstrate this with an example,

     ```js
     const collection = {
       one: 1,
       two: 2,
       three: 3,
       [Symbol.iterator]() {
         const values = Object.keys(this);
         let i = 0;
         return {
           next: () => {
             return {
               value: this[values[i++]],
               done: i > values.length
             }
           }
         };
       }
     };

     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();

     console.log(iterator.next());    // ‚Üí {value: 1, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next());    // ‚Üí {value: 2, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next());    // ‚Üí {value: 3, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next());    // ‚Üí {value: undefined, done: true}
     ```

     The above process can be simplified using a generator function,

     ```js
     ```

409. ### What is a Proper Tail Call?
     First, we should know about tail call before talking about "Proper Tail Call". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas **Proper tail call(PTC)** is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.

     For example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto `n * factorial(n - 1)`

     ```js
     function factorial(n) {
       if (n === 0) {
         return 1
       }
       return n * factorial(n - 1)
     }
     console.log(factorial(5)); //120
     ```

     But if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.

     ```js
     function factorial(n, acc = 1) {
       if (n === 0) {
         return acc
       }
       return factorial(n - 1, n * acc)
     }
     console.log(factorial(5)); //120
     ```

     The above pattern returns the same output as first one. But the accumulator keeps track of total as an argument without using stack memory on recursive calls.

410. ### How do you check an object is a promise or not?

  If you don't know if a value is a promise or not, wrapping the value as `Promise.resolve(value)` which returns a promise

     ```js
        function isPromise(object){
          if(Promise && Promise.resolve){
            return Promise.resolve(object) == object;
          }else{
            throw "Promise not supported in your environment"
          }
        }

        var i = 1;
        var promise = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
          resolve()
        });

        console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
        console.log(isPromise(p)); // true
    ```

   Another way is to check for `.then()` handler type

   ```js
    function isPromise(value) {
      return Boolean(value && typeof value.then === 'function');
    }
    var i = 1;
    var promise = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
      resolve()
    });

    console.log(isPromise(i)) // false
    console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true
   ```

411. ### How to detect if a function is called as constructor?
     You can use `new.target` pseudo-property to detect whether a function was called as constructor(using the new operator) or as regular function call.

     1. If a constructor or function invoked using the new operator, new.target returns a reference to the constructor or function.
     2. For function calls, new.target is undefined.

     ```js
     function Myfunc() {
         if (new.target) {
            console.log('called with new');
         } else {
            console.log('not called with new');
         }
     }

     new Myfunc(); // called with new
     Myfunc(); // not called with new
     Myfunc.call({}); not called with new
     ```

```javascript
var car = new Vehicle("Honda", "white", "2010", "UK");
console.log(car);

function Vehicle(model, color, year, country) {
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
    this.year = year;
    this.country = country;
}
```

- 1: Undefined
- 2: ReferenceError
- 3: null
- 4: {model: "Honda", color: "white", year: "2010", country: "UK"}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 4

The function declarations are hoisted similar to any variables. So the placement for `Vehicle` function declaration doesn't make any difference.

```js
function foo() {

- 2: ReferenceError: X is not defined
- 3: 1, undefined and number
- 4: 1, number and number

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Of course the return value of `foo()` is 1 due to increment operator. But the statement `let x = y = 0` declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,
```js
 let x;
 window.y = 0;
 x = window.y;
```
Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable `y` is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.

##### Answer: 4
The statements order is based on event loop mechanism. The order of statements follows the below order,

1. At first, the main function is pushed to the stack.
2. Then the browser pushes the fist statement of main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executed and popped out immediately.
3. But `setTimeout` statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.
4. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.
5. The callback of `setTimetout` moved from Browser API to message queue.
6. The `main` function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute
7. The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.
8. The console.log for B is added to the stack and display on the console.

#### 4. What is the output of below equality check?
```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3);
```

- 1: false
- 2: true


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1
This is due to float point math problem. Since the floating point numbers are encoded in binary format, the addition operations on them leads to rounding errors. Hence, the comparison of floating point doesn't give expected results.

#### 5. What is the output of below code?
```js
var y = 1;
  if (function f(){}) {
    y += typeof f;
  }
  console.log(y);
```

- 1: 1function
- 2: 1object
- 3: ReferenceError
- 4: 1undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4
The main points in the above code snippets are,
1. You can see function expression instead function declaration inside if statement. So it always returns true.
2. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too.

In other words, it is same as
```js
var y = 1;
  if ('foo') {
    y += typeof f;
  }
  console.log(y);
```
**Note:** It returns 1object for MS Edge browser

#### 6. What is the output of below code?
```js
function foo() {
  return
  {
    message: "Hello World"
  };
}
console.log(foo());
```

- 1: Hello World
- 2: Object {message: "Hello World"}
- 3: Undefined
- 4: SyntaxError

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3
This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.

Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with return keyword then function going to be returned as expected.
```js
function foo() {
  return {
    message: "Hello World"
  };
}
console.log(foo()); // {message: "Hello World"}
```

#### 7. What is the output of below code?
```js
var myChars = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
delete myChars[0];
console.log(myChars);
console.log(myChars[0]);
console.log(myChars.length);
```

- 1: [empty, 'b', 'c', 'd'], empty, 3
- 2: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], empty, 3
- 3: [empty, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4
- 4: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3
The `delete` operator will delete the object property but it will not reindex the array or change its length. So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed.
If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use `empty` instead of `undefined` to make the difference a bit clearer.

The important point is that if the statement contains same operators(e.g, < or >) then it be evaluated from left to right.
The first statement follows the below order,
1. console.log(1 < 2 < 3);
2. console.log(true < 3);
3. console.log(1 < 3); // True converted as `1` during comparision
4. True

Whereas the second statement follows the below order,
1. console.log(3 > 2 > 1);
2. console.log(true > 1);
3. console.log(1 > 1); // False converted as `0` during comparision
4. False

}
printNumbersArrow(1, 2, 3);
```

- 1: 1, 2, 3
- 2: 3, 2, 3
- 3: SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not allowed in this context
- 4: 1, 2, 1

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2
In non-strict mode, the regular JavaScript functions allow duplicate named parameters. The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters.
The value of first parameter mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.

**Note:** In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.

#### 13. What is the output of below code?
```js
const arrowFunc = () => arguments.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

- 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
- 2: 3
- 3: undefined
- 4: null

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1
Arrow functions do not have an `arguments, super, this, or new.target` bindings. So any reference to `arguments` variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive reference error.

Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the function
```js
const func = function () {
                    return arguments.length;
                    }
console.log(func(1, 2, 3));
```
But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected arguments
```js
const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

#### 14. What is the output of below code?
```js
console.log( String.prototype.trimLeft.name === 'trimLeft' );
console.log( String.prototype.trimLeft.name === 'trimStart' );
```

- 1: True, False
- 2: False, True

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2
In order to be consistent with functions like `String.prototype.padStart`, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as `trimStart`. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still act as a alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4
-Infinity is the initial comparant because almost every other value is bigger. So when no arguments are provided, -Infinity is going to returned.

- 4: False, True

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1
As per the comparison algorithm in the ECMAScript specification(ECMA-262), the above expression converted into JS as below
```js
10 === Number([10].valueOf().toString()) // 10
```
So it doesn't matter about number brackets([]) around the number, it always converted to a number in the expression.

#### 22. What is the output of below code?
```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.indexOf(NaN));
```

- 1: 4
- 2: NaN
- 3: SyntaxError
- 4: -1

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4
The `indexOf` uses strict equality operator(===) internally and `NaN === NaN` evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always.
But you can use `Array.prototype.findIndex` method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use `Array.prototype.includes` to check if NaN is present in an array or not.
```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); // 4

console.log(numbers.includes(Number.isNaN)); // true
```

##### Answer: 3
When using rest parameters, trailing commas are not allowed and will throw a SyntaxError.
If you remove the trailing comma then it displays 1st answer

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1
Async functions always return a promise. But even if the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,
```js
function func() {
   return Promise.resolve(10)
}
```

- 2: 10
- 3: SyntaxError
- 4: Promise¬†{<resolved>: undefined}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4
The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated of as existing in a `.then` callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of `undefined` is returned as the resolution of the promise.  The above async function is equivalent to below expression,
```js
function func() {
   return Promise.resolve(10).then(() => undefined)
}
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4
The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just run the tasks and go next. Hence, the last statement is displayed first followed by sequence of promise resolutions.

But you control the array sequence using for..of loop,

```js
async function processArray(array) {
  for (const item of array) {
    await delayedLog(item);
  }
  console.log('Process completed!');
}

##### Answer: 3
Symbol follows below conventions,

1. Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique irrespective of the optional string.
2. `Symbol.for()` function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't  necessarily create a new symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry.

**Note:** The symbol description is just useful for debugging purpose.

- 3: It is a not a string!, It is a number!
- 4: It is a string!, It is a number!

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4
The return value of `typeof myNumber (OR) typeof myString` is always the truthy value (either "number" or "string"). Since ! operator converts the value to a boolean value, the value of both `!typeof myNumber or !typeof myString` is always false. Hence the if condition fails and control goes to else block.

##### Answer: 2
The symbols has below constraints,

1. The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array.
2. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns empty object({}).

##### Answer: 2
If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error `Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` as mentioned above.

You can avoid the error with either of the below changes,
1. **Pass atleast an empty object:**

```js
function area({length = 10, width = 20}) {
  console.log(length*width);
}

area({});
```

2. **Assign default empty object:**

```js
function area({length = 10, width = 20} = {}) {
  console.log(length*width);
}

area();
```
